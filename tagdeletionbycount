-- THE RELIABLE & EFFICIENT TAG DELETION SCRIPT (User-Specified Count)
-- This version uses the most robust method for finding tags by letting DEVONthink's
-- own database engine do the counting, and then uses fast batch-deletion.

-- Define variables
set tagsToDelete to {}
set tagNamesToDelete to {}
set targetCount to 0

try
	-- === STEP 1: GET USER INPUT ===
	repeat until targetCount > 0
		try
			set dialogResult to display dialog "Enter the exact number of items a tag must have to be deleted:" default answer "1" buttons {"Cancel", "Continue"} default button "Continue"
			set userInputText to text returned of dialogResult
			set targetCount to userInputText as integer
			if targetCount < 1 then
				display alert "Invalid Number" message "Please enter a whole number greater than 0."
				set targetCount to 0
			end if
		on error number errNum
			if errNum is -128 then error "User cancelled the operation." number -128
			display alert "Invalid Input" message "Please enter a valid whole number (e.g., 1, 2, 3)."
		end try
	end repeat
	
	set pluralSuffix to "s"
	if targetCount is 1 then set pluralSuffix to ""

			error "No tags found in the database to check."
		end if
		
		show progress indicator "Finding tags with " & targetCount & " item" & pluralSuffix & "..." steps totalTagCount
		
		-- This loop is reliable. For each tag, we ask DEVONthink for its usage count.
		repeat with aTagRecord in allTagRecords
			set theTagName to name of aTagRecord
			step progress indicator "Checking: " & theTagName
			
			set foundRecords to lookup records with tags {theTagName} in theDatabase
			
			-- The condition uses the user-provided 'targetCount' variable.
			if (count of foundRecords) is targetCount then

				set end of tagNamesToDelete to theTagName

	tell application id "DNtp"
		show progress indicator "Deleting " & deletionCount & " tags in a single batch..." steps -1
		delete record tagsToDelete
		hide progress indicator

	-- === STEP 5: FINAL REPORT ===

	set finalReportText to tagNamesToDelete as text
	set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ""
